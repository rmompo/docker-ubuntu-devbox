# 04 - Volumes and user

## Context
VS Code and Docker must point to the same projects folder on the host. The container's user is defined when the container is created, not in the image.

## Reasoning
1. Code must outlive the container -> bind mounts to host folders.
2. Host paths differ between machines -> `container-create` asks for them, with defaults.
3. The mount target depends on the user -> `/home/<user>/devbox/...`.
4. With `-v`, Docker Desktop creates a missing folder, which contradicts the rule "if it does not exist, do nothing" -> use `--mount type=bind` plus prior validation: nothing is created and the script aborts.
5. The user needs sudo, protected by a password for safety -> `sudo` group without `NOPASSWD`.
6. Remembering a separate password is inconvenient in a local environment -> password equals the user name (weak by design, acceptable locally).

## Decision
- **Host paths** (asked when creating the container):
  - Projects: `C:\Localfiles\proyectos\`
  - Resources: `C:\shared\devbox\resources\`
- **Container targets:** `/home/<user>/devbox/proyectos` and `/home/<user>/devbox/resources`.
- **Missing path:** `container-create` aborts with an error and creates nothing.
- **User:** `dkdb-<input>`; by default, the full container name. It is validated (lowercase, at most 32 characters) before creating anything.
- **Password:** equal to the full user name (example: `dkdb-user1`).
- **Sudo:** the user is a sudoer, always with a password.

## Consequences
- Permissions inside Windows bind mounts are handled by Docker Desktop, not by `chown`.
- The password is weak by design; the container must not be exposed to untrusted networks.
- The user is never named `ubuntu`, so it cannot clash with the user shipped in newer images.
