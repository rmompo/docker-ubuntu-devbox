# 01 - Global conventions

## Context
Several scripts and the image share names, encoding and ways of interacting with the user. It is best to fix these once.

## Reasoning
1. Scripts must find the project's resources on their own -> a common prefix lets them filter without touching foreign resources.
2. Filtering by plain `dkdb` would also match `dkdbfoo` -> filter by `dkdb-`, with the hyphen.
3. The prefix may change (it already changed twice) -> define it in a single file loaded by every script.
4. Files are used from both Linux and Windows -> everything is UTF-8 without BOM and LF; a BOM breaks `#!/bin/bash`.
5. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less `.ps1` as ANSI and corrupts non-ASCII characters -> `.ps1` files are pure ASCII, so no BOM is needed and the PowerShell version does not matter.
6. The project owner wants everything in English -> documentation, scripts, prompts, messages and comments are English, which is also naturally ASCII.
7. Users must pick from lists -> a dependency-free, reusable navigable menu.

## Decision
- **Language:** English for documentation, scripts, prompts, messages and comments.
- **Prefix:** `dkdb`, defined in one common place. Image, container and user are named `dkdb-<input>`; default input value: `ubuntu`.
- **Length:** `dkdb-` takes 5 characters; the typed text allows up to 27 (Linux limits user names to 32).
- **Filtering:** always by `dkdb-`.
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 without BOM and LF for every file. A BOM would only be used in a `.ps1` that needs non-ASCII characters (currently none).
- **`.gitattributes`:** `* text=auto eol=lf`, after reviewing the existing content.
- **Menu:** common function `Select-DevboxItem`, navigation only: up/down arrows, Enter confirms, Esc cancels. No numbers. ASCII, no external modules.

## Consequences
- Changing the prefix means editing one line.
- The menu needs an interactive console; it does not work without a keyboard.
